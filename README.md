## Computer Vision Sandbox

All my personal, non-academic computer vision research lies here.

I've written all my projects in C++ so far and build them with help from CMake, so I can practice using these standard tools to make fast, lightweight standalone applications that are relatively easy to integrate with hardware like GPUs and TPUs. Check out my setup at [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md)

Here are all my projects so far:

| Name | Description |
|-----:|:------------|
[HelloWorld](src/01-HelloWorld) | A basic project that shows an image via OpenCV
