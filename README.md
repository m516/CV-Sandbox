## Computer Vision Sandbox

All my personal, non-academic computer vision research lies here.

So far, all my projects are written in C++. This allows me to practice using standard, free tools to make fast, lightweight standalone applications that are relatively easy to integrate with hardware like GPUs and TPUs. Check out my setup at [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md)

Here are all my projects so far:

| Name | Description |
|-----:|:------------|
[Hello World](src/01-HelloWorld) | A basic project that loads with OpenCV and displays it in a window
[Hello GLFW](src/02-HelloGLFW) | A basic project that creates a window and an OpenGL context with GLFW and GLAD
