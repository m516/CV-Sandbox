# Project 11: GL_Game <!-- omit in toc -->]
This project is an exploration of OpenGL, aiming to recreate the core functionality of a game that had previously been written in [Python](https://github.com/m516/WYSIWYG-2/blob/master/wysiwyg2/data/wysiwyg.py) and then [Processing Java](https://github.com/m516/WYSIWYG-2)

![GIF of the game working](docs/screenshots/11-01.gif)

The layout of this game engine is not conducive for expansion, so it was my inspiration and basis for [my lightweight C++ UI Template](https://github.com/m516/Cpp-UI-Template).
